Within a class, struct or interface: 

 • Constant Fields
 • Fields
 • Constructors
 • Finalizers (Destructors)
 • Delegates
 • Events
 • Enums
 • Interfaces (interface implementations)
 • Properties
 • Indexers
 • Methods
 • Structs
 • Classes

Within each of these groups order by access:

 • public
 • internal
 • protected internal
 • protected
 • private

Within each of the access groups, order by static, then non-static: 
 • static
 • non-static

Within each of the static/non-static groups of fields, order by readonly, then non-readonly :

 • readonly
 • non-readonly

An unrolled list is 130 lines long, so I won't unroll it here. The methods part unrolled is:

 • public static methods
 • public methods
 • internal static methods
 • internal methods
 • protected internal static methods
 • protected internal methods
 • protected static methods
 • protected methods
 • private static methods
 • private methods
